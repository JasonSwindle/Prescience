## New Relic monitoring for AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Setting up New Relic in Elastic Beanstalk can be haphazard, and confusing. The aim of this project is to:

* A single file for easy deployment
* Should monitor everything that New Relic has to offer:
  * Application monitoring 
  * NGINX / Apache monitoring via Plug-ins
  * Server Monitoring
